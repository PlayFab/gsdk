# ThirdPersonMP Example - GSDK Project Setup

This guide covers upgrading the finished Unreal ThirdPersonMP template and tutorial project, by adding and configuring the PlayFab GSDK. By following this guide, you will upgrade your existing project so it can be hosted on PlayFab Multiplayer Services.

Please note, your Unreal project must have the following capabilities:

* Networking
* Multiplayer
* Dedicated Game-Server

If not, you will need to return to the [ThirdPersonMP Example Project Setup](ThirdPersonMPSetup.md) guide to configure your project as a network-enabled multiplayer game, with dedicated server capabilities.

## Goals

We will add and configure the Playfab Unreal GSDK to your project, and test it locally to verify it is expected to work on PlayFab Multiplayer Services.

## Requirements

* Download Visual Studio. The [community version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is free.
	* Required workloads: .NET desktop development and Desktop development with C++
* Download Unreal Engine Source Code. This plugin was tested on Unreal Engine 4.26.2. For instructions, see [Downloading Unreal Engine Source code (external)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/DownloadingSourceCode/).
* A completed [ThirdPersonMP Example Project](ThirdPersonMPSetup.md), or a project with similar capabilities
* [PlayFab Unreal GSDK plugin](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdk/tree/master/UnrealPlugin)
* [Optional] [PlayFab Marketplace plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/product/playfab-sdk) or the [source version on GitHub](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnrealMarketplacePlugin/tree/master/4.26/PlayFabPlugin/PlayFab). This plugin is not required for GSDK but is required for many PlayFab services, including login.

## C++ Implementation

### Adding the plugin to the project

Follow these steps to add the Unreal GSDK to your project:

* Go to your Unreal game project
* Open File Explorer and create a **Plugins** folder in your games' root directory. In the Plugins folder, create a folder called **PlayFabGSDK.**
* Go to **{depot}\\GSDK\\gsdk\\UnrealPlugin**. Drag all the files from the **UnrealPlugin** folder into the **Plugins/PlayFabGSDK** folder.
* Lastly, open your game project's **.uproject** file in a text editor of your choice. In the plugins array, add the "PlayFabGSDK" plugin.

See the example below:

```json
{
    "FileVersion": 3,
    "EngineAssociation": "4.26",
    "Category": "",
    "Description": "",
    "Modules": [
        {
            "Name": "<projectname>",
            "Type": "Runtime",
            "LoadingPhase": "Default",
            "AdditionalDependencies": [
                "Engine"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Plugins": [                    // Add this if it doesn't exist
        {                           // Add this
            "Name": "PlayFabGSDK",  // Add this
            "Enabled": true         // Add this
        }                           // Add this
    ]                               // Add this if it doesn't exist
}
```

### Include the plugin in your modules

Update <modulename>.Build.cs file to add "PlayFabGSDK" into the PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(); list as follows:

```csharp
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "HeadMountedDisplay", "PlayFabGSDK" });
```

Right-click on the .uproject file and select the option to __Switch Unreal Engine version__, which is how you can quickly check which Unreal Engine version you are currently using. The popup seen below should appear. If you already see that the Unreal Engine version is source build, you donâ€™t need to change anything, so click Cancel. If the Unreal version is not currently the source build, select it from the dropdown list and then click OK.

Right-click on the .uproject file again and select "Generate Visual Studio Project Files".

Then, build the project in Visual Studio and start the Editor by selecting the Development Editor configuration.

![image depicting Visual Studio with the option to build in Development Editor Mode](Documentation/DevelopmentEditor.png)

### Project Setup

Once your project has enabled server mode, you will have a <projectname>Server.Target.cs file.

Result should look similar to:

```csharp
public class <projectname>ServerTarget : TargetRules
{
    public <projectname>ServerTarget( TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Server;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
        ExtraModuleNames.AddRange( new string[] { "<projectname>" } );

	// You may have additional configuration based on your server needs
    }
}
```

For Windows builds, you may need to add these optional configurations:

```csharp
DisablePlugins.Add("WMFMediaPlayer");
DisablePlugins.Add("AsyncLoadingScreen"); //if you are using this plugin
DisablePlugins.Add("WindowsMoviePlayer");
DisablePlugins.Add("MediaFoundationMediaPlayer");
```
NOTE: These configurations are invalid for a Linux server build.

### Creating/Updating the GameInstance Class

#### Creating a GameInstance Class

If you are in the process of creating a game from scratch and do not yet have a GameInstance class, then first follow these example instructions to create a GameInstance class. If you are using a game that already has a GameInstance class, (for example, ShooterGame from Unreal's sample library), then move on to the section titled _**Modify the GameInstance Class**_.

----

In the Unreal Editor, go to Files->Create a new C++ class and select the option to "Show all classes". Then search for GameInstance. By selecting it directly, everything should be generated correctly and then you can add the functions we detail below.

Then close Unreal and generate project files in source build mode again.

Then using Visual Studio, open those newly created files and follow instructions to modify the Game Instance class.

#### Modify the Game Instance Class

Locate your GameInstance class, which is most likely called something similar to [your game name]GameInstance or MyGameInstance. From now on, your game instance class will be denoted with [YourGameInstanceClassName].

##### Modifying the GameInstance header file

First, check the include statements and ensure that the following are included in the header file for your GameInstance class ([YourGameInstanceClassName].h):

```cpp
#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "Engine/GameInstance.h"
#include "MyGameInstance.generated.h"
```

Then, add the following declarations to the public section: (If you already have an Init() function, there is no need to include another declaration)

```cpp
public:

    virtual void Init() override;
    virtual void OnStart() override;
```

Then, add the following declarations to the protected section of methods:

```cpp
protected:

    UFUNCTION()
    void OnGSDKShutdown();

    UFUNCTION()
    bool OnGSDKHealthCheck();
};
```

##### Modifying the GameInstance Cpp file

Then, locate the [YourGameInstanceClassName].cpp file.

Make sure that the following are included:

```cpp
#include "[YourGameInstanceClassName].h"
#include "PlayfabGSDK.h"
#include "GSDKUtils.h"
```

Then locate your Init() function. If you _**don't**_ have an Init() function yet, then add in the function as such:

###### Creating Init() function

```cpp
void U[YourGameInstanceClassName]::Init()
{
    FOnGSDKShutdown_Dyn OnGsdkShutdown;
    OnGsdkShutdown.BindDynamic(this, &UMyGameInstance::OnGSDKShutdown);
    FOnGSDKHealthCheck_Dyn OnGsdkHealthCheck;
    OnGsdkHealthCheck.BindDynamic(this, &UMyGameInstance::OnGSDKHealthCheck);

    UGSDKUtils::RegisterGSDKShutdownDelegate(OnGsdkShutdown);
    UGSDKUtils::RegisterGSDKHealthCheckDelegate(OnGsdkHealthCheck);
}
```

----

If you already **had** an Init() function, go to check in [YourGameInstanceClassName].cpp file to see if you have a variable that indicates whether the instance is for a dedicated server. **If you can find this variable**, then add in this in at the end of your Init() function:

###### Modifying Existing Init() function

```cpp
	if (IsDedicatedServerInstance() == true)
	{
		FOnGSDKShutdown_Dyn OnGsdkShutdown;
		OnGsdkShutdown.BindDynamic(this, &UShooterGameInstance::OnGSDKShutdown);
		FOnGSDKHealthCheck_Dyn OnGsdkHealthCheck;
		OnGsdkHealthCheck.BindDynamic(this, &UShooterGameInstance::OnGSDKHealthCheck);

		UGSDKUtils::RegisterGSDKShutdownDelegate(OnGsdkShutdown);
		UGSDKUtils::RegisterGSDKHealthCheckDelegate(OnGsdkHealthCheck);

		OnStart();
	}
```

**If you can't find a variable like IsDedicatedServerInstance(),** we still want to make sure that ReadyForPlayers() and onStart() are used when using a dedicated server, so you could wrap the call to ReadyForPlayers() as such at the bottom of the Init function:

```cpp
#if UE_SERVER
    UGSDKUtils::SetDefaultServerHostPort();
    if (!UGSDKUtils::ReadyForPlayers())
    {
        FPlatformMisc::RequestExit(false);
    }
#endif
```

----

Lastly, add these method implementations to the bottom of [YourGameInstanceClassName].cpp file:

```cpp
void UMyGameInstance::OnStart()
{
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Reached onStart!"));
    if (!UGSDKUtils::ReadyForPlayers())
    {
        FPlatformMisc::RequestExit(false);
    }
}

void UMyGameInstance::OnGSDKShutdown()
{
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Shutdown!"));
    FPlatformMisc::RequestExit(false);
}

bool UMyGameInstance::OnGSDKHealthCheck()
{
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Healthy!"));
    return true;
}
```

## Blueprint implementation

* Observe the Content Browser window in the Unreal Editor
* Pick or create a folder to contain new Blueprints
* Right-Click and create a Blueprint class
* In the All classes dropdown menu find your GameInstance class
	* In this example the blueprint is named "MyGameInstance"
* Double-click the blueprint
* On the left side hover over the function field and select the Override dropdown
* Select the Init function
* Right-click in the graph and add in all register GSDK function
* For GSDK Shutdown and Maintenance Delegate drag out the a line from the red square, and select "Add Custom Event"
* For "Register GSDK Health Check Delegate" select the "Create Event" in the "Event Dispatchers".
* ![PlayFab GSDK Health Check select function](Documentation/BlueprintAddRegisterHealthCheckDelegate.png)
* In the dropdown of the new node "Create matching function". **This is important, as the GSDK Health Check Delegate has a return value.**
* ![PlayFab GSDK Health Check select function](Documentation/BlueprintRegisterHealthCheckDelegate.png)
* In the function make sure the return boolean value is checked.
* ![PlayFab GSDK Health Check function](Documentation/BlueprintGSDKHealthCheckFunction.png)
* Don't forget to connect all the nodes to the Event Init node.
* In the end add the "Ready for Players" to be able to react to the ready signal of PlayFab.

## Set the Game Instance class

After creating a custom game instance class that integrates with the gsdk, you have to configure your project to actually use this newly created game instance class. There are two ways to do this - either through the Unreal Engine editor or by editing DefaultEngine.ini directly.

### In the Unreal Editor

In the editor, this can also be set through the UI in the editor. In the editor go to Edit -> Project Settings. From that opened window,
navigate to Maps&Modes on the left side. Scroll to the bottom, and then you can set the option "Game Instance Class" to your new game instance class directly, and avoid typos.

### In DefaultEngine.ini

Or you can update DefaultEngine.ini file and add this:

```ini
[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]
GameInstanceClass=/Script/[game name].MyGameInstance
```

## Include Pre-requisites for Windows Dedicated Server

There are two ways to include the app-local prerequisites - either through the Unreal Engine editor or by editing DefaultGame.ini.

### In the Unreal Editor

In the editor go to Edit -> Project Settings. In the opened window navigate to Packaging on the left side. Scroll to the bottom of the list, and tick "Include app-local prerequisites".

### In DefaultGame.ini

Or you can update DefaultGame.ini to show the following:

```ini
[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]
IncludeAppLocalPrerequisites=True
```

If the category already exists in your DefaultGame.ini, then just add the second line to it. This ensures that all app local dependencies ship with the game as well.

If you are using Continuous Integration (CI), then you could add it to your setup to only turn this flag on when building a dedicated server, so the additional dlls only get added if it is a dedicated server build.

## Navigation

You are now ready to [build your project](ThirdPersonMPBuild.md) on your local machine.

Alternately, you can return to the main [Unreal GSDK Plugin](README.md#unreal_project_build_configurations) guide.
