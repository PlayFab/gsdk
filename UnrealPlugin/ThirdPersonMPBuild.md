The purpose of this guide is to describe all the build configurations needed to test and verify your Unreal project.

## Goals

* Build the "Development Editor"
* Build a game client
* Build the "Development Server"
* Build a release Server

## Requirements

- Download Visual Studio (the [community version is free](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/))
	- Requires Workloads: .NET desktop development, and Desktop development with C++
- Download Unreal Engine Source Build by following [these instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/DownloadingSourceCode/) from the Unreal Engine website. This was tested on [4.26.2](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/tag/4.26.2-release) (Link requires permissions)

You are now ready to [deploy your game server](ThirdPersonMPLocalDeploy.md) to PlayFab MPS and test your project in the cloud.

Alternately, you can return to the main [Unreal GSDK Plugin](README.md#deploy-to-playfab) guide.
